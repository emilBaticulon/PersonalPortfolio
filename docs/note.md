# Behance about

I am a creative by heart, a tinkerer by nature, and an aspiring front end developer. I find great pleasure in technology and discovery. I just love to learn new things!

I'm an indoor guy - I enjoy watching sci-fi and fantasy movies and DIY videos at home. Not an ordinary, I listen to horror stories on YouTube before I sleep.

Furthermore, I am an aspiring photographer, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end and back-end web development world. I always say that every day is a learning process, because as a designer I believe that we should always ask questions and never stop learning.
